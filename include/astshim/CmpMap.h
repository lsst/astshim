/**
Abstract base class for @ref SeriesMap and @ref ParallelMap

@ref CmpMap is a compound @ref Mapping which allows two component
@ref Mapping "Mappings" (of any class) to be connected together to form a more
complex @ref Mapping. This connection may either be "in series"
(where the first @ref Mapping is used to transform the coordinates of
each point and the second mapping is then applied to the
result), or "in parallel" (where the first @ref Mapping transforms the
lower numbered coordinates for each point and the second @ref Mapping
simultaneously transforms the higher numbered coordinates).

Since a @ref CmpMap is itself a @ref Mapping, it can be used as a
component in forming further CmpMaps. @ref Mapping "Mappings" of arbitrary
complexity may be built from simple individual @ref Mapping "Mappings" in this
way.

### Attributes

@ref CmpMap has no attributes beyond those provided by @ref Mapping and @ref Object.

@warning CmpMap will sometimes appears as a SeriesMap or ParallelMap, as appropriate, including:
- getClassName() will return "SeriesMap" or "ParallelMap", as appropriate
- A CmpMap persisted using a Channel or pickle will be unpersisted as a SeriesMap or ParallelMap

    @param[in] map2  Second mapping.
