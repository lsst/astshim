TranMap is a Mapping which combines the forward transformation of
a supplied Mapping with the inverse transformation of another
supplied Mapping, ignoring the un-used transformation in each
Mapping (indeed the un-used transformation need not exist).

When the forward transformation of the TranMap is referred to, the
transformation actually used is the forward transformation of the
first Mapping supplied when the TranMap was constructed. Likewise,
when the inverse transformation of the TranMap is referred to, the
transformation actually used is the inverse transformation of the
second Mapping supplied when the TranMap was constructed.
