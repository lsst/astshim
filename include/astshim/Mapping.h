/**
An abstract base class for objects which transform one set of coordinates to another.

Mapping is used to describe the relationship which exists between two different
coordinate systems and to implement operations which make use of
this (such as transforming coordinates and resampling grids of data).

### Attributes

In addition to those attributes common to @ref Object,
Mapping also has the following attributes:
- @ref Mapping_Invert "Invert": Is the mapping inverted?
- @ref Mapping_IsLinear "IsLinear": Is the Mapping linear?
- @ref Mapping_IsSimple "IsSimple": Has the Mapping been simplified?
- @ref Mapping_NIn "NIn": Number of input coordinates for a Mapping
- @ref Mapping_NOut "NOut": Number of output coordinates for a Mapping
- @ref Mapping_Report "Report": Report transformed coordinates to stdout?
- @ref Mapping_TranForward "TranForward": Is the forward transformation defined?
- @ref Mapping_TranInverse "TranInverse": Is the inverse transformation defined?

    An inverse mapping is a deep copy of a mapping whose @ref Mapping_Invert "Invert" attribute

    and of "forward" and "inverse". Thus it swaps the behavior of @ref applyForward and @ref applyInverse,
    @ref getNIn and @ref getNOut, @ref hasForward and @ref hasInverse and so on.

    Note that the inverse mapping contains exactly the same model coefficients as the original,
    but they are used by @ref applyInverse instead of @ref applyForward. Thus for example if a @ref ZoomMap
    has a zoom factor of 4.0 then its inverse also reports a zoom factor of 4.0 (despite behaving

    and then multiplied the result by 10, could be simplified to a single step which multiplied by 50.
    Similarly, a Mapping which multiplied by 5, and then divided by 5, could be reduced to
    a simple copying operation.

    This function should typically be applied to Mappings which have undergone substantial processing
    or have been formed by merging other Mappings. It is of potential benefit, for example,

    @param[in] tol  The maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may be introduced as a result of

                This should be expressed as a displacement within the output coordinate system of the Mapping.

                If piece-wise linear approximation is not required, a value of zero may be given.
                This will ensure that the Mapping is used without any approximation, but may increase
                execution time.

                If the value is too high, discontinuities between the linear approximations used
                in adjacent panel will be higher.  If this is a problem, reduce the tolerance
                value used.
    @param[in] maxpix  A value which specifies an initial scale size (in input grid points) for the adaptive
                algorithm which approximates non-linear Mappings with piece-wise linear transformations.
                Normally, this should be a large value (larger than any dimension of the region
                of the input grid being used).  In this case, a first attempt to approximate the
                Mapping by a linear transformation will be made over the entire input region.
                If a smaller value is used, the input region will first be divided into sub-regions
                whose size does not exceed " maxpix" grid points in any dimension.  Only at this
                point will attempts at approximation commence.
                This value may occasionally be useful in preventing false convergence of the adaptive
                algorithm in cases where the Mapping appears approximately linear on large scales,
                but has irregularities (e.g.  holes) on smaller scales.  A value of, say, 50 to
                100 grid points can also be employed as a safeguard in general-purpose software,
                since the effect on performance is minimal.
                If too small a value is given, it will have the effect of inhibiting linear approximation
                altogether (equivalent to setting " tol" to zero).  Although this may degrade
                performance, accurate results will still be obtained.
