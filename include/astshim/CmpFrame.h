/**
A CmpFrame is a compound Frame which allows two component Frames (of any class)
to be merged together to form a more complex Frame.

The axes of the two component Frames then appear together
in the resulting CmpFrame (those of the first Frame, followed by
those of the second Frame).

Since a CmpFrame is itself a Frame, it can be used as a
component in forming further CmpFrames. Frames of arbitrary
complexity may be built from simple individual Frames in this
way.

### Attributes

@ref CmpFrame has no attributes beyond those provided by @ref Frame and @ref Object.
However, the attributes of the component Frames can be accessed as if they were attributes
of the CmpFrame. For instance, if a CmpFrame contains a SpecFrame
and a SkyFrame, then the CmpFrame will recognise the "Equinox"
attribute and forward access requests to the component SkyFrame.
Likewise, it will recognise the "RestFreq" attribute and forward
access requests to the component SpecFrame. An axis index can
optionally be appended to the end of any attribute name, in which
case the request to access the attribute will be forwarded to the
primary Frame defining the specified axis.
