/**
A parallel @ref CmpMap "compound mapping" where the first @ref Mapping is used
to transform the lower numbered coordinates of each point
and the second @ref Mapping is used to transform the remaining coordinates.

Since a @ref ParallelMap is itself a @ref Mapping, it can be used as a
component in forming further @ref ParallelMap "ParallelMaps".
@ref Mapping "Mappings" of arbitrary complexity may be built from simple
individual @ref Mapping "Mappings" in this way.

@warning ParallelMap is a convenience wrapper around CmpMap. Specialized code hides some
of this, so getClassName() will return "ParallelMap" and an ParallelMap persisted using a Channel
or pickle will be returned as a "ParallelMap" in Python. However, it will be visible in
other ways, such as the output from show().

### Attributes

@ref ParallelMap has no attributes beyond those provided by @ref Mapping and @ref Object.
