/**
A PcdMap is a non-linear @ref Mapping which transforms 2-dimensional positions to correct for
the radial distortion introduced by some cameras and telescopes. This can take the form
either of pincushion or barrel distortion, and is characterized by a single distortion coefficient.
A PcdMap is specified by giving this distortion coefficient and the coordinates of the centre of
the radial distortion. The forward transformation of a PcdMap applies the distortion:

    RD = R * ( 1 + disco * R * R )

where `R` is the undistorted radial distance from `pcdcen`, the distortion centre,
`RD` is the radial distance from the same centre in the presence of distortion.

The inverse transformation of a PcdMap removes the distortion produced by the forward transformation.
The expression used to derive `R` from `RD` is an approximate inverse of the expression above,
obtained from two iterations of the Newton-Raphson method. The mismatch between the forward
and inverse expressions is negligible for astrometric applications (to reach 1 milliarcsec
at the edge of the Anglo-Australian Telescope triplet or a Schmidt field would require
field diameters of 2.4 and 42 degrees respectively).

### Attributes

In addition to those attributes provided by @ref Mapping and @ref Object,
@ref PcdMap has the following attributes:

- @anchor PcdMap_Disco `Disco`: pincushion/barrel distortion coefficient.

    The pincushion/barrel distortion coefficient.
    For pincushion distortion, the value should be positive.
    For barrel distortion, it should be negative.
    0 gives no distortion.

    Note that the forward transformation of a PcdMap applies the distortion
    specified by this attribute and the inverse transformation removes this distortion.

- @anchor PcdMap_PcdCen `PcdCen(axis)`: Centre coordinates of pincushion/barrel distortion.
