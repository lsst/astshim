/**
A @ref Mapping which normalises coordinate values using the @ref Frame.norm "norm" method
of the supplied @ref Frame. The number of inputs and outputs of a @ref NormMap
are both equal to the number of axes in the supplied @ref Frame.

The forward and inverse transformation of a @ref NormMap are both
defined but are identical (that is, they do not form a real inverse
pair in that the inverse transformation does not undo the
normalisation, instead it reapplies it). However, @ref Mapping.simplify
will replace neighbouring pairs of forward and inverse
@ref NormMap "NormMaps" by a single @ref UnitMap (so long as the @ref Frame "Frames" encapsulated by
the two @ref NormMap "NormMaps" are equal - i.e. have the same class and the same
attribute values). This means, for instance, that if a @ref CmpMap contains
a @ref NormMap, the @ref CmpMap will still cancel with its own inverse.

### Attributes

@ref NormMap has no attributes beyond those provided by @ref Mapping and @ref Object.
