/**
Channel provides input/output of AST objects.

Writing an @ref Object to a @ref Channel will generate a textual
representation of that @ref Object, and reading from a @ref Channel will
create a new @ref Object from its textual representation.

Note that a channel cannot be deep-copied because the contained stream cannot be deep-copied

### Missing Methods

- astPutChannelData is used internally and should not be called directly.

### Attributes

@ref Channel provides the following attributes, in addition to those provided by @ref Object

- @ref Channel_Comment "Comment": Include textual comments in output?
- @ref Channel_Full "Full": Set level of output detail.
- @ref Channel_Indent "Indent": Indentation increment between objects.
- @ref Channel_ReportLevel "ReportLevel": Selects the level of error reporting
- @ref Channel_Skip "Skip": Skip irrelevant data?
- @ref Channel_Strict "Strict": Generate errors instead of warnings?
