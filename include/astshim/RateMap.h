/**
RateMap is a @ref Mapping which represents a single element of the
Jacobian matrix of another @ref Mapping. The @ref Mapping for which the
Jacobian is required is specified when the new RateMap is created,
and is referred to as the "encapsulated @ref Mapping" below.

The number of inputs to a RateMap is the same as the number of inputs
to its encapsulated @ref Mapping. The number of outputs from a RateMap
is always one. This one output equals the rate of change of a
specified output of the encapsulated @ref Mapping with respect to a
specified input of the encapsulated @ref Mapping (the input and output
to use are specified when the RateMap is created).

A RateMap which has not been inverted does not define an inverse
transformation. If a RateMap has been inverted then it will define
an inverse transformation but not a forward transformation.

### Attributes

@ref RateMap has no attributes beyond those provided by @ref Mapping and @ref Object.
