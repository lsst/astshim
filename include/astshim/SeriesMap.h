A series @ref CmpMap "compound mapping" where the first @ref Mapping is used
to transform the coordinates of each point and the second @ref Mapping
is then applied to the result.

Since a SeriesMap is itself a Mapping, it can be used as a
component in forming further @ref SeriesMap "SeriesMaps". @ref Mapping "Mappings" of arbitrary
complexity may be built from simple individual @ref Mapping "Mappings" in this way.

@warning SeriesMap is a convenience wrapper around CmpMap. Specialized code hides some
of this, so getClassName() will return "SeriesMap" and an SeriesMap persisted using a Channel
or pickle will be returned as a "SeriesMap" in Python. However, it will be visible in
other ways, such as the output from show().

### Attributes

@ref SeriesMap has no attributes beyond those provided by @ref Mapping and @ref Object.
