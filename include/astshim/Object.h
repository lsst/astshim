Object provides the following attributes:

- @ref Object_ID "ID": object identification string that is not copied.
- @ref Object_Ident "Ident": object identification string that is copied.
- @ref Object_NObject "NObject": number of Objects in class
- @ref Object_ObjSize "ObjSize": the in-memory size of the Object in bytes
- @ref Object_RefCount "RefCount": count of active Object pointers
- @ref Object_UseDefs "UseDefs": allow use of default values for Object attributes?

    Lock this object for exclusive use by the calling thread.

    The thread-safe public interface to AST is designed so that an
    error is reported if any thread attempts to use an @ref Object that it
    has not previously locked for its own exclusive use using this
    function. When an @ref Object is created, it is initially locked by the
    thread that creates it, so newly created objects do not need to be
    explicitly locked. However, if an @ref Object pointer is passed to
    another thread, the original thread must first unlock it (using
    astUnlock) and the new thread must then lock it (using astLock)
    before the new thread can use the @ref Object.

    @param[in] wait  If the @ref Object is curently locked by another thread then this
       function will either report an error or block. If a non-zero value
       is supplied for "wait", the calling thread waits until the object
       is available for it to use. Otherwise, an error is reported and
       the function returns immediately without locking the @ref Object.

    ### Notes

    - The Locked object will belong to the current AST context.
    - This function returns without action if the @ref Object is already
    locked by the calling thread.
    - If simultaneous use of the same object is required by two or more
    threads, @ref Object.copy should be used to to produce a deep copy of
    the @ref Object for each thread. Each copy should then be unlocked by
    the parent thread (i.e. the thread that created the copy), and then
    locked by the child thread (i.e. the thread that wants to use the
    copy).
    - This function returns without action if the AST library has
    been built without POSIX thread support (i.e. the "-with-pthreads"
    option was not specified when running the "configure" script).
