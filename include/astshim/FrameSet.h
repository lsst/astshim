/**
A @ref FrameSet consists of a set of one or more @ref Frame "Frames" (which
describe coordinate systems), connected together by @ref Mapping "Mappings"
(which describe how the coordinate systems are inter-related).

A @ref FrameSet makes it possible to obtain a @ref Mapping between any pair
of these @ref Frame "Frames" (i.e. to convert between any of the coordinate
systems which it describes).  The individual @ref Frame "Frames" are
identified within the @ref FrameSet by an integer index, with @ref Frame "Frames"
being numbered consecutively from one as they are added to the
@ref FrameSet.

Every @ref FrameSet has a "base" @ref Frame and a "current" @ref Frame (which
are allowed to be the same). Any of the @ref Frame "Frames" may be nominated
to hold these positions, and the choice is determined by the
values of the @ref FrameSet's Base and Current attributes, which hold
the indices of the relevant @ref Frame "Frames".  By default, the first @ref Frame
added to a @ref FrameSet is its base @ref Frame, and the last one added is
its current @ref Frame.

The base @ref Frame describes the "native" coordinate system of
whatever the @ref FrameSet is used to calibrate (e.g. the pixel
coordinates of an image) and the current @ref Frame describes the
"apparent" coordinate system in which it should be viewed
(e.g. displayed, etc.). Any further @ref Frame "Frames" represent a library
of alternative coordinate systems, which may be selected by
making them current.

When a @ref FrameSet is used in a context that requires a @ref Frame,
(e.g. obtaining its Title value, or number of axes), the current
@ref Frame is used. A @ref FrameSet may therefore be used in place of its
current @ref Frame in most situations.

When a @ref FrameSet is used in a context that requires a @ref Mapping,
the @ref Mapping used is the one between its base @ref Frame and its
current @ref Frame. Thus, a @ref FrameSet may be used to convert "native"
coordinates into "apparent" ones, and vice versa. Like any
@ref Mapping, a @ref FrameSet may also be inverted (see @ref Mapping.getInverse),
which has the effect of interchanging its base and current @ref Frame "Frames" and
hence of reversing the @ref Mapping between them.

Regions may be added into a @ref FrameSet (since a Region is a type of
@ref Frame), either explicitly or as components within @ref CmpFrame "CmpFrames". In this
case the @ref Mapping between a pair of @ref Frame "Frames" within a @ref FrameSet will
include the effects of the clipping produced by any Regions included
in the path between the @ref Frame "Frames".

### Attributes

In addition to those attributes common to @ref Frame @ref Mapping and @ref Object,
@ref FrameSet also has the following attributes:

- @ref FrameSet_AllVariants "AllVariants": a list of all variant mappings stored with the current @ref Frame
- @ref FrameSet_Base "Base": index of base @ref Frame, starting from 1
- @ref FrameSet_Current "Current": index of current @ref Frame, starting from 1
- @ref FrameSet_NFrame "NFrame": Number of Frames in a FrameSet
- @ref FrameSet_Variant "Variant": name of variant mapping in use by current Frame

Every FrameSet also inherits any further attributes that belong
to its current @ref Frame, regardless of that @ref Frame's class. (For
example, the `Equinox` attribute, defined by @ref SkyFrame, is
inherited by any FrameSet which has a @ref SkyFrame as its current
@ref Frame.) The set of attributes belonging to a FrameSet may therefore
change when a new current @ref Frame is selected.

    @param[in] iframe  The index of the Frame within the FrameSet which describes the coordinate system
        upon which the new one is to be based.  This value should lie in the range from
        1 to the number of frames already in this FrameSet (as given by @ref getNFrame).
        A value of FrameSet::BASE or FrameSet::CURRENT may be given to specify the base @ref Frame

        A value of `AST__ALLFRAMES` is not permitted; call `addAllFrames` instead.
    @param[in] map  A @ref Mapping which describes how to convert coordinates from the old coordinate
        system (described by the @ref Frame with index `iframe` ) into coordinates in the
        new system.  The Mapping's forward transformation should perform this conversion,
        and its inverse transformation should convert in the opposite direction.
    @param[in] frame  A @ref Frame that describes the new coordinate system.  Any type of @ref Frame
        may be supplied (including Regions and FrameSets).
        This function may also be used to merge two FrameSets by supplying a pointer to
        a second FrameSet for this parameter (see the Notes section for details).

    ### Notes

    - Deep copies of the supplied `map` and `frame` are stored within the modified FrameSet.
        So any changes made to the FrameSet after calling this method will have no effect on the supplied
        @ref Mapping and @ref Frame objects.
    - This function sets the value of the `Current` attribute for the FrameSet so that the new @ref Frame
        subsequently becomes the current @ref Frame.
    - The number of input coordinate values accepted by the supplied `map` (its NIn attribute)
        must match the number of axes in the @ref Frame identified by the `iframe` parameter.
        Similarly, the number of output coordinate values generated by `map` (its NOut attribute)
        must match the number of axes in `frame`.
    - As a special case, if a pointer to a FrameSet is given for the `frame` parameter,
        this is treated as a request to merge `frame` into this FrameSet. This is done by appending
        all the new @ref Frame "Frames" in the `frame` FrameSet to this FrameSet,
        while preserving their order and retaining all the inter-relationships (i.e. @ref Mapping "Mappings")
        between them. The two sets of @ref Frame "Frames"
        are inter-related within the merged FrameSet by using the @ref Mapping supplied.
        This should convert between the @ref Frame identified by the `iframe` parameter (in this FrameSet)
        and the `current` @ref Frame of the `frame` FrameSet. This latter @ref Frame becomes
        the current @ref Frame in this FrameSet.

    Likewise, if the value of the Variant attribute is requested, the

    This provides a mechanism for propagating the effects of variant
    Mappings around a @ref FrameSet. If a new @ref Frame is added to a @ref FrameSet

       in the @ref FrameSet (as given by @ref getNFrame).
       If `AST__NOFRAME` is supplied (or the current @ref Frame is specified),
       then any mirroring established by a previous call to this function is disabled.
       A value of FrameSet::BASE may be given to specify the base frame.

    ### Notes:
    - Mirrors can be chained. That is, if @ref Frame B is set to be a mirror
        of @ref Frame A, and @ref Frame C is set to be a mirror of @ref Frame B, then
        @ref Frame C will act as a mirror of @ref Frame A.
    - Variant Mappings cannot be added to the current @ref Frame if it is
        mirroring another @ref Frame. So calls to @ref addVariant
        will cause an error to be reported if the current @ref Frame is
        mirroring another @ref Frame.
    - Any variant Mappings explicitly added to the current @ref Frame using @ref addVariant
        will be ignored if the current @ref Frame is mirroring another @ref Frame.

        a more straightforward method of making the required changes to the @ref FrameSet.
    - This function cannot be used to change the number of @ref Frame axes.
