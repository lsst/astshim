/**
A Mapping which "zooms" a set of points about the origin by multiplying all coordinate values
by the same scale factor.

The inverse transformation is performed by dividing by this scale factor.

### Attributes

In addition to those attributes provided by @ref Mapping and @ref Object,
@ref ZoomMap has the following attributes:

- @anchor ZoomMap_Zoom `Zoom`: scale factor.

    Create a ZoomMap

    @param[in] ncoord  The number of coordinate values for each point to be transformed (i.e.  the number
              of dimensions of the space in which the points will reside).  The same number
              is applicable to both input and output points.
    @param[in] zoom  Initial scale factor by which coordinate values should be multiplied (by the forward
              transformation) or divided (by the inverse transformation).  This factor may subsequently
              be changed via the ZoomMap's `Zoom` attribute. It may be positive or negative,
              but should not be zero.
    @param[in] options  Comma-separated list of attribute assignments.
