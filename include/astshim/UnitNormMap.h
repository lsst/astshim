/**
The forward transformation of a UnitNormMap subtracts the specified centre
and then transforms the resulting vector to a unit vector and the vector norm.
The output contains one more coordinate than the input: the initial NIn outputs
are in the same order as the input; the final output is the norm.

The inverse transformation of a UnitNormMap multiplies each component
of the provided vector by the provided norm and adds the specified centre.
The output contains one fewer coordinate than the input: the initial NIn inputs
are in the same order as the output; the final input is the norm.

UnitNormMap enables radially symmetric transformations, as follows:
- apply a UnitNormMap to produce a unit vector and norm (radius)
- apply a one-dimensional mapping to the norm (radius), while passing the unit vector unchanged
- apply the same UnitNormMap in the inverse direction to produce the result

### Attributes

@ref UnitNormMap has no attributes beyond those provided by @ref Mapping and @ref Object.
