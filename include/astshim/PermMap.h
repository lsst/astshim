/**
A @ref Mapping which permutes the order of coordinates, and possibly also changes
the number of coordinates, between its input and output.

In addition to permuting the coordinate order, a PermMap may also assign constant values to coordinates.
This is useful when the number of coordinates is being increased as it allows fixed values to be assigned
to any new ones.

### Attributes

@ref PermMap has no attributes beyond those provided by @ref Mapping and @ref Object.

    /**
    Construct a PermMap

    Unlike AST's astPermMap, you must always provide non-empty inperm and outperm vectors.

    @param[in] inperm  A vector of `nin` elements; each element specifies the number of the
            output coordinate whose value is to be used (note that this array
            therefore defines the inverse coordinate transformation).
            Coordinates are numbered starting from 1.
    @param[in] outperm  A vector of `nout` elements; each element specifies the number of the
            input coordinate whose value is to be used (note that this array
            therefore defines the forward coordinate transformation).
            Coordinates are numbered starting from 1.
            Values may also be negative; see the `constant` parameter for details.
    @param[in] constant  An vector containing values which may be assigned to input and/or output
              coordinates instead of deriving them from other coordinate values.  If either
              of the `inperm` or `outperm` arrays contains a negative value, it is used to
              address this `constant` array (such that -1 addresses the first element, -2 addresses
              the second element, etc.)  and the value obtained is used as the corresponding
              coordinate value.
    @param[in] options  Comma-separated list of attribute assignments.

    @throws std::invalid_argument if:
    - `inperm` or `outperm` are empty
    - `inperm` or `outperm` specify a constant that is not available because `constant` has too few elements.
